# single-page-cv

A simple single-page HTML CV for the roadmap.sh project “Single-Page CV”.

## 🧾 Project Overview

This repository contains a minimal, semantic HTML-only CV page (`cv.html`). The goal is to build a clean, well-structured single-page résumé that demonstrates:

- Proper semantic HTML structure  
- Sections for education, skills, and career history  
- Essential SEO metadata and Open Graph (OG) tags in the `<head>`  
- A linked favicon for better presentation  

This implementation aligns with the requirements of the “Single-Page CV” project from roadmap.sh. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
